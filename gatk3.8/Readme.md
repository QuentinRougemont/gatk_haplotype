 * scripts for gatk3.8 do not work with the v4 since the syntax has been changed  

## PURPOSE: Pipeline For read mapping and SNP calling with GATK 

 * The `02_genome` should contain your reference genome  
 * The `03_raw_data` must contain your raw fastq sequencing data  
 * Other folder will be created when running the pipeline
